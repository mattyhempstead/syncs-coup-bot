# Alpha Coup

Some coup bot thing or something.

## TODO:

- Move common stuff into common (and ensure make submission still works).
- Fix type errors.

## Engine

Run with `python -m coup.engine.engine`.

## Maths


`1 - 12/15 * 11/14 = 0.37`
So ~37% chance of having a given Character.
i.e. Around 1/3 games we can block assassinations.


`9/15 * 8/14 = ~0.34`
So ~34% chance of not having two given characters.
e.g. 1/3 chance of not having Duke OR Captain
